# HTML5 Placeholder
Nothing really special that HTML5 does not implement cross-browser these days. But back in the day, we had to wrangle an awful lot of JavaScript to do this.

## *onBlur*
Sets the textbox's text to grey and the default text if the textbox is empty.

## *onFocus*
Sets the textbox's text to black if text is default, and clears the textbox.
